# Problem Statement
Many SaaS platforms require a centralized service to manage customers, their accounts, and lifecycle states (trial, active, suspended, churned).

This project simulates such a core service, focusing on correctness, scalability, and maintainability rather than UI.

# Description

Customer Management API is a production-style backend service written in Go that models real-world customer lifecycle management for SaaS platforms.

The service provides RESTful APIs to manage customers, accounts, and status transitions with support for multi-tenancy, role-based access control, pagination, filtering, and audit-friendly soft deletes.

The project emphasizes clean architecture, testability, and backend engineering best practices rather than basic CRUD operations.
